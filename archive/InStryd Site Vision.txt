InStryd Site Vision

You can find our current site at www.instryd.com. The template that we currently use is great, but we had to rip a lot of the content out because it just wasn't applicable at the time. This has left our site with a rather bland, empty feel to it. Below is a quick summary of our site, and I'm sure I left something out. Let me know if you have any questions. Our main priority right now is to clean up the site and make it more presentable.


What we want
Bootstrap/Responsive design
Red/Grey/White color scheme
Current site too bland/boring. Need help making it more visually appealing
Priority is to improve the event listing page(http://www.instryd.com/events). We want this to be more presentable while we add more content/functionality to the site.
Note: Our upcoming photo content will be similar to a "Nike Running" theme. Google "Nike Running" for example pictures if


Current Features
Atropos Template
Ruby on Rails framework deployed using Heroku
Amazon S3 Storage for event/bib photos
Blog/event Listing
Admins can create blog/events
Bib(User) Registration with email confirmation
Events are using isotope library http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
What's next
User Profiles aka Bibs
A bib contains a profile photo and the user's name centered at the top of the page. No Bio.
A bib will display someone's tracked races
Use Case: User finds event on the events listing page and selects "Track". The tracked event will then appear on their Bib. Can reuse functionality of the isotope library
Comments on Blog/Events
Event registration (Will use Stripe or Braintree for the payment processing most likely)
